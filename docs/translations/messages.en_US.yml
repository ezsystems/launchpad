    intro:
        blurb: "An tool that will help you build an %ez% project on top of %docker% in less than 5 minutes."
        well: >
            You will end up with a full <strong>Docker stack</strong>where the source-code
            is on your host for you <strong>to start coding</strong> right away!

    demo:
        title: "Demo"
        blurb: >
            This is a demo of an <a href="#initstack">initialization</a>, starting from scratch,
            you will get everything ready to code, commit and push!

    install:
        title: "Installation"
        toolinstalled: "If you have <strong>%tool%</strong> installed:"

    usage:
        title: "Usage"
        blurb: "When you have installed eZ Launchpad (<em>~/ez</em>) you can start enjoying the feature."
        2mainfeatures: "eZ Launchpad provides 2 mains features:"
        init: "<strong>Initialization</strong> of a brand new eZ Platform Stack (on top of Docker)"
        create: "<strong>Create</strong> the Docker Stack related to the current directory."
        fromscratch: "Start from scratch"
        bootstrap: "Boostrap an existing project"
        init.title: "Init<small>ialization</small>"
        init.blurb: >
                That is the from scratch installation.
                You need to do that when you have nothing and you want to start a new project with eZ Platform.
        init.willaskquestion: "From here eZ Launchpad will ask you a bunch of question to configure your project."
        init.macosxwarning: "Mac OS X users will have a wizard to set up <a href='#d4m' class='alert-link'>D4M</a>."
        init.end.steps: "At the end of the procedure those steps will be done for you:"
        init.end.steps.1: "Configuration your project locally."
        init.end.steps.2: "Download(pull) the correct image on your Docker Daemon."
        init.end.steps.3: "Set up a eZ compliant <em>docker-compose.yml</em>."
        init.end.steps.4: "Create and start the containers required.(depending of the choices you made)"
        init.end.steps.5: "Install Composer in the Engine container.(where PHP is executed in your Stack)"
        init.end.steps.6: "Install eZ Platform through Composer inside the stack."

        init.end.finished.ps: "Once the Initialization is finished, the project is up, you can check doing:"
        init.end.finished.dump: "You are now ready dump the database and storage, git commit and push to share the project to your teams."
        init.end.finished.entreprise: >
                Whether you want to use an entreprise version or a non-stable, you have the choice! Look at the help.
                There is an example:
        init.end.finished.httpbasics: >
                When eZ Launchpad will ask you about HTTP-BASIC, then you have to provide the
                <a href="https://doc.ez.no/display/TECHDOC/Using+Composer" target="_blank">Installation Key and the Token</a>.

        create.title: "Create"
        create.blurb: "In this context you have already a project somewhere, someone already did a <em>~/ez init</em>"
        create.gitpull: "Then it most likely that you did"
        create.projectready: >
                If you want to know if your project is eZ Launchpad ready, you can just check the existance of
                <em>.ezlaunchpad.yml</em> at the root directory of your project.
        create.localstack: "To create the local stack the command is then"
        create.whathasbeendone: "Here eZ Launchpad will pull the images, create the containers of your stack as well a importing the database/storage."

    deploy:
        title: "Deployment"
        blurb: >
            eZ Launchpad can help you to deploy as well. Even if it is optional and you can deploy the way you want
            we wanted to provide simplifications.
        platformsh: "Platform.sh"
        platformsh.blurb: >
            <a href="https://platform.sh/product">Platform.sh</a> is a PaaS (<strong>P</strong>latform <strong>a</strong>s <strong>a</strong> <strong>S</strong>ervice)<br />
            With Platform.sh there is no real deployment process to run manually. Platform.sh will just create and synchronize environments based on your git repository!
        platformsh.blurb2: >
            eZ Launchpad provides you a way to set up your eZ Project to be Platform.sh ready.
        platformsh.setup.subtitle: "Setup"
        platformsh.setup.blurb: >
            This command will create and generate files required by Platform.sh. Because eZ Launchpad knows your project and the services you need it will adapt the
            Plaftorm.sh configuration files to it.
        platformsh.setup.listfile: "Here is the list of files that are going to be created."
        platformsh.setup.dump: "Because you will need to initialize the database and the storage on Platform.sh (the first time), eZ Launchpad will also create a dump."
        platformsh.deploy.subtitle: "Deploy"
        platformsh.deploy.blurb: >
            As mentioned there is not real "deployment" process, this command will just display some documentation.

    stack:
        title: "Stack"
        blurb: "At anytime you can get information on your stack by running"
        moreorlessservice: "Depending on the initialization, you might have more or less services, but here are the most common stack."

    commands:
        title: "Common Commands"
        blurb: "eZ Launchpad is done to help you with a local Docker stack."
        list: "To do so, here is the command available to you:"

    configuration:
        title: "Global configuration"
        blurb: >
            Because every project can share stuff and because you might want the same configuration everywhere.
            eZ Launchpad read a configuration file in your HOME directory.
        fileexample: >
            This configuration file is <em>~/ezlaunchpad/ez.yml</em>. Here is a full example:
        fileexample.description: >
            Note that this configuration is global and won't be including in the project (i.e in the CVS repository).
            But it will be including in your local stack.
        fileexample.description.dockersectionisnext: "<em>docker</em> section is described in the next section."

    d4m:
        title: "Mac OS X optimizations with D4M"
        blurb: >
            When it comes to share folder from the Host(your mac) to containers
            <em>Docker for Mac</em> is slow. (at least for now).
            Then to manage this performance issue, <strong>there is a workaround</strong>.
        workaround: >
            This workaround is called <a href="https://github.com/IFSight/d4m-nfs">D4M</a>.
            Without entering into the details, D4M uses the MobbyVM that runs beside Docker for Mac and NFS mounts your mac.
        nfsfaster: "Note: It might be odd, but yes NFS is faster than the default mount."
        setup: "Still when you use D4M, you can set it up:"
        setup.1: "in a transparent way: Then no configuration is required with eZ Launchpad"
        setup.2: "limitating the folder that you export: In this case, you need to tell it to eZ Launchpad"

        example: "If you have customized the D4M configuration, let's say, that you have exported"
        example.mounted: >
            And you have mounted this exported folder in <em>/data/MYPROJECTS</em> in the MobyVM (through D4M).
            Then you need to add this configuration for eZ Launchpad
        example.mounted.host_composer_cache_dir: >
            <em>host_composer_cache_dir</em> will allow you to share the composer cache for all your projects.
